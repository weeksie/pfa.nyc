# What now?<a name="except-back" href="#except">*</a>

So we've decided to work together. Good call.

## Getting to know the people

First order of business is to get a feel for where the development
team is at in terms of skill and workflow. Being agile is not about
following a strict set of guidelines and rules. Being agile is about
doing what works, and what works depends on context.

## Getting to know the code and the business

Next up, unless this is a green field project, I'll spend time
understanding the codebase. Bugfixes and small features. In the
process I'll get an idea for where the business is and how good the
communication lines are between stakeholders and production.

## The work

At this point I have a pretty good feel for the project and the people
working on it. I'll present work plans going forward, as sprint
cycles, milestones, or whatever combination makes sense for the team.

## For instance. . . .

### The agency team that needs to get across a new programming language or technology

The principal of a small agency approaches me because her developers
are building a project in React and they seem to be struggling with
it. They are capable and have a perfectly serviceable workflow. All
they need is some information and a nudge in the right direction.

This is one of the few circumstances where I feel pair programming is
appropriate. This team knows what they're doing, they don't have a
sprawling codebase in need of surgery. All they need is some help and
the total time spent is likely three to five business days.


### The large corporation with a new project

Perhaps the project has been attempted before and a trail of dead lies
in its wake. Maybe it's a green field. In either case, the "getting to
know you" phase can take between one and three weeks. This includes
learning about the crucial systems that are a part of the company's
ecosystem.

The next step is fitting the demands of the business into a cycle that
works for the development team. The business needs big monthly
milestones? Fine, but the dev team can still work in short, one-week
sprints.


### The development shop with its biggest project ever

The team is smart but maybe a little inexperienced. The project is big
enough to send a few shivers down the spines of the project
manager. People are concerned about their eye to stomach ratios and
things are only just beginning.

The "getting to know you" period in a situation like this is mostly
about observing how a team works. What are the natural inclinations
and personalities of the developers? How do they fit with the rest of
the business, with the client managers and with the design team?

Given all of that, how can work be structured in a way that helps
everybody succeed?

Designing a process for the team doesn't happen all at once,
especially if there wasn't much of one to begin with. This is an
organic event that takes place over the course of a project.

**People talk a lot about reusable code, but a good development culture is
infinitely more reusable.**
