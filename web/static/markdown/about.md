# Fine, so who are you?

Hi! I'm Scotty. Pleased to meet you. I've been doing this for a long
time.

### 2000-2003
**SEATTLE** It was the height of the dot com bubble. There was this
crazy utopian vibe shaking the city, it was intoxicating and I couldn't
help but dip my toes in the water to see what the fuss was about.

After some digging around, I learned a little server magic. PHP was my
gateway drug. After that things escalated: Java, Ruby, Python, C, Lua,
Haskell, and more soon followed.

In 2002 I started *twelvestone*, a forum for designers and
developers. At its height, there were around 10k active users. It had
many incarnations: an old vBulletin setup, two different custom Rails
forums, and now it exists as a small Slack channel. There's probably a
metaphor in there about the evolution of the web, but I'm not going to
dig too deep.

### 2003-2008
**SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA** In '03/04 the Ruby users group was also the
Smalltalk users group on account of there not being enough of either
camp to hold a proper meetup. Ruby was not a popular language back
then. Times have sure changed, huh?

In 2006 I co-founded [Snepo](snepo.com) with two workmates. We built
amazing stuff: A Lua-based kiosk platform with hundreds of
installations--touch screens before the word "haptic" was used in
polite conversation. A massively parallel video encoding server
written in Erlang. A document database with a REST API written in
Haskell *in 2006*. And, of course, lots of Rails.


### 2008-now
**NEW YORK** I sold my third of Snepo and moved back to the US where I
consulted for Gucci, Indaba Music, Gin Lane, WebMD, and a ton of
others. Was VP Engineering for a startup
called [Plyfe](http://plyfe.com). Built an MVP dating app that got up
to about 3k MAUs before I shelved it for other reasons. Lots of good
times.

So now it's 2017.

I still spend my time building interesting stuff and helping smart
people be super rad.

[Give me a shout](mailto:scott.weeks@gmail.com?subject=Let's get some coffee). Let's
get some coffee and get to know each other.

## Other stuff

I do other stuff too. I write essays and fiction, some of which you
can see at [scottyweeks.com](http://www.scottyweeks.com). I also blog
about economics
at [howlittlewisdom.com](http://www.howlittlewisdom.com). And, of
course, you can feel free to stalk me on
github [@weeksie](https://github.com/weeksie) if that's your thing.

## PFA? Who?

A while back, I was riffing fake energy drink slogans with some
friends and came up with: "I feel like my arms are made of pit
bulls!" As luck would have it I also needed a name for my S-Corp.

*Pitbulls For Arms, INC* was born.  Aside from TD Bank asking me if my
business had anything to do with dog fighting, it hasn't been a big
deal.
